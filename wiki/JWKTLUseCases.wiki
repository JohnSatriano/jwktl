= JWKTL Use Cases =

This page focuses on use cases for accessing a certain kind of information type from Wiktionary using JWKTL. Before taking a look at this page, make sure that JWKTL is correctly installed and follow the [GettingStarted getting started] guide. This should equip you with an instance of `IWiktionaryEdition`, JWKTL's representation of a single parsed Wiktionary language edition (e.g., the English Wiktionary). In the following sections, we focus on accessing the individual information types encoded in Wiktionary. For brevity, we won't be able to describe the information types in detail, which is why we refer you to the publications mentioned on the project homepage.


== Accessing the parsed information ==

== Article pages ==

The primary building blocks of Wiktionary are article pages, which contain lexicographic information on a specific word form (e.g., "boat"). This can include multiple parts of speech (e.g., the noun and the verb "plant") and multiple languages (e.g., "fog" in English and Hungarian). JWKTL makes use of the `IWiktionaryPage` interface to represent these article pages. They may be queried either by their unique ID or the described word form. For each page, the title (i.e., the word form), the date, revision ID, and author of the last revision, the language of the embracing Wiktionary language edition, the set of language codes occuring as interwiki-links, and the target of a possible redirection. Code example:

{{{
  WiktionaryFormatter formatter = WiktionaryFormatter.instance();

  // Query by ID.
  IWiktionaryPage page = wkt.getPageForId(7377);
  System.out.println(formatter.formatHeader(page));

  // Query by word form.
  page = wkt.getPageForWord("boat");
  System.out.println(formatter.formatHeader(page));
}}}

== Lexical entries ==

Each combination of language and part of speech described on an article page yields a separate instance of `IWiktionaryEntry` (i.e., multiple lexical entries sharing the same page). Besides the language and the part of speech, an entry encodes the etymology, gender (if applicable), pronunciations, inflected word forms, as well as links to a related entry containing more information (e.g., in case of alternative spellings). The entries can be accessed using the `IWiktionaryPage` instance they are contained in or using the API directly. Note that search queries are case sensitive by default and thus return different results for looking up "rom", "Rom", or "ROM". An optional parameter can be used to initiate case insensitive search. Code example:

{{{
  // Access by page.
  List<IWiktionaryEntry> entries = page.getEntries();
  for (IWiktionaryEntry entry : entries)
    System.out.println(WiktionaryFormatter.instance().formatHeader(entry));

  // Query by word form (case sensitive).
  entries = wkt.getEntriesForWord("boat");
  for (IWiktionaryEntry entry : entries)
    System.out.println(WiktionaryFormatter.instance().formatHeader(entry));

  // Query by word form (case insensitive).
  entries = wkt.getEntriesForWord("rom", true);
  for (IWiktionaryEntry entry : entries)
			System.out.println(WiktionaryFormatter.instance().formatHeader(entry));
}}}

== Extracting semantic relations ==

== Extracting translations ==

Wiktionary encodes a large number of translations, which are represented as a hyperlink from one article to another. The German translation of the English word _boat_ can, for instance, be accessed using the following code:

{{{
  IWiktionaryEdition wkt = Wiktionary.open(WIKTIONARY_DIRECTORY);
  IWiktionaryPage page = wkt.getPageForWord("boat");
  for (IWiktionaryEntry entry : page.getEntries())
    if (entry.getPartOfSpeech() == PartOfSpeech.NOUN)
      for (IWiktionaryTranslation translation : entry.getTranslations(Language.GERMAN))
        System.out.println(translation.getTranslation());
  wkt.close();
}}}

Accordingly, it is easy to print a list of all translations encoded for the noun _boat_:

{{{
  IWiktionaryEdition wkt = Wiktionary.open(WIKTIONARY_DIRECTORY);
  IWiktionaryPage page = wkt.getPageForWord("boat");
  for (IWiktionaryEntry entry : page.getEntries())
    if (entry.getPartOfSpeech() == PartOfSpeech.NOUN)
      for (IWiktionaryTranslation translation : entry.getTranslations())
        System.out.println(translation.getLanguage() + ": " + translation.getTranslation());
  wkt.close();
}}}

For the semantic relations, we have seen that many of them are associated with a certain word sense. This also applies to the translations. The following sample code extracts the German translations of the first word sense of _boat_ (i.e., the meaning of a water vessel):

{{{
  IWiktionaryEdition wkt = Wiktionary.open(WIKTIONARY_DIRECTORY);
  IWiktionaryPage page = wkt.getPageForWord("boat");
  IWiktionaryEntry entry1 = page.getEntry(0);
  IWiktionarySense sense1 = entry1.getSense(0);
  for (IWiktionaryTranslation translation : sense1.getTranslations(Language.GERMAN))
      System.out.println(translation.getTranslation());
  wkt.close();
}}}

Again, translations that could not be associated to a specific word sense are gathered within the dummy sense:

{{{
  IWiktionaryEdition wkt = Wiktionary.open(WIKTIONARY_DIRECTORY);
  IWiktionaryPage page = wkt.getPageForWord("boat");
  IWiktionaryEntry entry1 = page.getEntry(0);
  IWiktionarySense unassigned = entry.getUnassignedSense();
  for (IWiktionaryTranslation translation : unassigned.getTranslations(Language.GERMAN))
      System.out.println(translation.getTranslation());
  wkt.close();
}}}
